This repository contains a minimal client for a human resource management system.

The `client` directory hosts a small React-based UI that demonstrates a home page
with a collapsible tree menu on the left side. It loads React 18 from a CDN so
no build step is required.

To preview the client, open `client/index.html` in a modern browser.
